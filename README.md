# Knight Hedge Template

This repository is structured following the principles of **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. The main idea is to decouple the different concerns of the application into layers, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and testability. Each layer has a clear responsibility, making it easier to navigate and extend the project as it grows.
